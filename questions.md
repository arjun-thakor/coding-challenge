Q.1 How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
Answer: I have spend few hours for this coding test. If I have more time then I would like add geographical map to this solution because openTable public API have address, name and longitude-latitude. According to me, I would like add feature like auto location detection and based on location display list of restaurants. In addition to this, I would prompt options to the user like cuisine type and what price you like and then based on selection display result.


Q.2 What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
Answer: I like to program in JavaScript. There are many features added to the latest version of JavaScript such as Promises, Regular expression and Asynchronous iteration.

The latest and current version of JavaScript is v9 ECMAScript 2018. Following is Promise sample code of ES2018:

    fetch('file.json')
    .then(data => data.json())
    .catch(error => console.error(error))
    .finally(() => console.log('finished'))


Q.3 How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer: I would track performance issue step by step. For example, if there is one button and one event will occured when you clicked it. So I will analyze the whole process, note down the other events related to this event and make break point at certain steps of production. Yes, I will say not like expert level but I have gone through performance while developing and testing web applications. But Planning ahead is key, and set up an early warning system through simulated user monitoring systems for mitigating the issues. Here are some example how you can track and resolve performance issues: 
1) Analzying the detail requirements and then preparing the testing scripts for it
2) Using different load to identify the latency for the response
3) writing bug free code and optimizing database
4) troubleshooting and debugging the endpoints


Q.4 How would you improve the API that you just used?
Answer:
There could be many ways of improving API and some of the parameters that I will consider to improve API is: 1) Using asynchronous methods
        2) Structuring the data and remove some unnnecessary information
        3) Implementing REST architecture


Q.5 Please describe yourself using JSON.
Answer:
Following is some describing about me in the form of JSON:

[
    {
        "first_name":"Arjunkumar",
        "middle_name":"Ramanbhai",
        "last_name":"Thakor",
        "email_address":"arjunthakor00740@gmail.com",
        "qualification":"Computer Programmer",
        "gender":"Male",
        "github":"https://github.com/arjun-thakor",
        "programming_languages":{
            "front_end":"for example JavaScript",
            "back_end":"for example Java"
        },
        "database":"MySQL for example",
        "interest":"Machine Learning and AI"
    }
]
